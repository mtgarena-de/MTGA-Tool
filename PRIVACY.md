# Privacy Policy

This document serves to inform our users about our policies regarding the collection and use of data we/us (the developers) obtain through the app ("MTG Arena Tool", "the application"), about the game ("Magic the Gathering Arena", "MTG Arena").
MTG Arena Tool gathers data from MTG Arena directly. Use this document as a reference as how we do that and what we do with the data obtained, as well as how to opt-out from certain parts of this process.

## Information MTG Arena Tool Collects:

While you use our services some information is sent to our servers. If you opt-out to provide us with this information you may not be able to access certain parts of our app, but you will still be able to utilize the rest of it with no problems "offline" with no further connections with our servers, the only action possible once you opt-out sharing is deletion of data stored online.

If you decide to use the app online you will be requested to "sign in", for this process we only require a valid email address and a secret password.

Once signed in, the information that is sent to us contains, or may contain, your MTG Arena User ID, nickname, IP address, and log of events in-game (which may contain deck lists, match results, draft picks, inventory, etc). We do not collect any personal information about you, nor we link any of this information with any user profiles or services you may already use besides MTG Arena and MTG Arena Tool. We do link your MTG Arena username with the Email address you use to sign in.

## How we use this information:

You email is used as a login credential, while we do not require this to be a legitimate email address, we do encourage users to provide a real one in case of password or data recovery.
Your MTG Arena user ID, user name and IP address are used to identify you and subsequent queries the client makes, as well as to keep a record of active users and (in the event of any abuses of service), deny access to our services.
MTG Arena user IDs are also used to save user preferences and logs of activity in the owner's computer. This information is *not* shared to our servers, but it is actively used by the application in order to differentiate multiple users on the same system and dsplay some data like past games action logs.
Events logs, results and deck lists are shared within the application to other users, which is visible publicly by anyone utilizing the app. This is also utilized to obtain different measurements of average deck lists, ie; most utilized cards, metagame shares, etc. Do notice we do not share user IDs publicly, and user name can be hidden from public view.
Some information is sent to our servers to provide a backup of data in case of data loss, this information contains matches, events entries and in-game economy tracking. ** Data restoration is still work in progress**
Any other information is solely used to perform offline tasks (not shared with us) and is displayed within the user interface of the app in various ways. Some of this data is stored on the user's system to keep track of settings and past games (like match win percentages).

We guarantee to never sell, share or provide access to your private data to any third parties. We will deny anyone from attempting to access or obtain this data unless we get explicit permission from the owner of such data.

## How to opt-out?

Within the user interface, browse to "Settings" and uncheck "Online sharing".
If you wish to erase all of your already-stored data click the button "Erase my shared data". You will be asked for confirmation, Please beware as this cannot be undone.

If you wish to download a copy of all the data about your user or have any other questions or concerns about privacy or data, please contact us at [mtgatool@gmail.com](mailto:mtgatool@gmail.com)
